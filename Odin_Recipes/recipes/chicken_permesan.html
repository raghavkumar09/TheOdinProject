    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>

        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>

        <li>2 large eggs</li>

        <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>

        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>

        <li>½ cup olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>

        <li>½ cup prepared tomato sauce</li>

        <li>¼ cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li>

        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>

        <li>½ cup grated provolone cheese</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch. Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper.</li>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <li>Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.</li>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <li>Place flour in a sifter or strainer; sprinkle over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides.</li>
        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <li>Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <h3>Step 7</h3>
        <li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</li>
        <h3>Step 8</h3>
        <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.</li>
        <h3>Step 9</h3>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ul>
